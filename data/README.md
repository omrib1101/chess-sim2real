# Data

The training datasets (synthetic and real chessboard images) are not included in this
repository due to size constraints (~300MB) and course data distribution policies.

The data was provided as part of the course materials and generated using the provided
Blender-based synthetic data generation pipeline.

Pretrained model checkpoints are provided and are sufficient for reproducing the reported
results and running inference.
